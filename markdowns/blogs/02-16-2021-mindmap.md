# Develop a Mindmapping software

Link Test [hello](http://www.google.com)

## Finding The Optimal Sub Problems

DFS, BFS, Backtracking, DP, Divide and conqure

## Finding The Data Structure

Stack, Heap, Binary Tree, Union-find

## Finding The Algorithm

KMP, Round-robin. Prefix Sum, Reservoir Sampling, Two pointers, Topological Sort, Greedy, random selection

1. Try to guess time complexity
   Especially O(n)
2. Use Recursion
3. Derive some knowledge

Inline code test `console.log('123')` test
